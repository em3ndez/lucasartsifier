"""The EMISSION MANIFEST -- a committed per-file digest of every emitted patch source tree.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The snapshot surface (`snapshot.py`) freezes whether a guard landed --
`applied`, `kind`, `sites`, the skip reason -- and never one byte of the SOURCE TEXT a placement
produced. Twice in one week a shipped-emission change went through a fully green suite (the
deny-path claim: KQ5 +34 lines across 10 files; the warned-bit merge: KQ5 5 files plus KQ6's
rm660), because NO tier at any level watched the emitted source. `tools/measure_emitted_bytes.py`
makes exactly the right comparison but is manual, so it catches only what someone remembers to
run. This module gives the suite a committed reference: per game, per emitted file, a sha256 --
so `test_emission_manifest.py` FAILS, naming the game and the file, when the emission moves.

Refreshing the manifest is a BLESS, same contract as any golden: present the delta, get sign-off,
only then run `tools/bless_emission.py --write`. A pure bit RENUMBERING (freed bits shifting later
allocations) fails this manifest too, deliberately -- benign drift is still drift someone must see.

WHAT IS HASHED. Everything the emit writes or could write: `src/**` (the appliers' whole output
surface), `game.ini` (script numbering -- a chooser script joining the set moves it), and any
other root-level file EXCEPT `resource.*` volumes, which `assemble` copies verbatim from the
stock game as compiler input -- multi-megabyte stock bytes, not emission. The loose patches
(`420.SCR`-shaped) ARE hashed: they are small, and a future applier emitting one at the root
should be caught, not scoped out.

THE SAVE-COMPAT HALF. ScummVM refuses a save unless script 0's size and the game object's offset
match the values stamped at save time (`savegame.cpp:1466-1469`); the v19 KQ5 rebuild moved
0.SCR 9948->9940 under UNTOUCHED Main.sc source and silently broke every existing save. Source
hashes cannot see that -- it was compiler-codegen drift -- so the manifest also freezes the
script-0 SIZE of every installed patch dir, and the test compares both the installs and the
newest version-numbered build trees against it. That failure's message says what it means:
installing it breaks saves.
